# Git Project Initialization Script

This project contains a Bash script to initialize a new Git project on UNIX/bash/macOS. The script automates the process of creating a new project directory, initializing a Git repository, creating a `README.md` file, a `.gitignore` file, and making the initial commit.

## Usage

1. **Run the script**:
```
./init_git_project.sh <project_name>
```
2. **Navigate to project directory**:
```
cd <project_name>
```
3. **Run setup remote repository script**:
```
./setup_remote.sh https://github.com/<git_username>/<project_name>.git
```
